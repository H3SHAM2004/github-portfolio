                <h2>QnA</h2>
                <p><strong>What College did I graduate from?</strong></p>
                <p>I graduated from Fanshawe College in London, Ontario Canada. 
                    I was enrolled in the Computer Programming and Analysis program in September 2022 and graduated in December 2025.</p>
                <p><strong>What are my career goals?</strong></p>
                <p>My goal is to become a skilled video game developer and contribute to creating immersive and engaging gaming experiences.</p>
                <p><strong>What has driven my passion for programming and wanting to become a video game developer?</strong></p>
                <p>I grew up a lot as a kid playing video games and was fascinated by how they were made. 
                    This curiosity led me to learn programming and pursue a career in game development. 
                    I believe that having the ability to create such an interactive experience is both challenging and rewarding.</p>
                <p><strong>What are my favorite video games of all time?</strong></p>
                <p>There are a lot of games I enjoyed playing over the years. 
                    In terms of storytelling and cinematic experiences, it has to be Red Dead Redemption 2.
                    In terms of pure gameplay and mechanics, easily would be DOOM Eternal.
                    Other favorite games include Cyberpunk 2077, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Sleeping Dogs, and Skate 3 just to name a few.</p>
